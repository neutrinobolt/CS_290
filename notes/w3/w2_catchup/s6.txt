CSS
Connect HTML file to CSS file w/ style rules:
    In Head:
        <link rel = "stylesheet"  href = "filename.type">

Styling:
    Selector {
        ruleset
        setting: rule;
    }

font
    font-family:
        select font for text
        Start with font you want, generalize
    font-style:
        for using italics
        ex. "font-style: italic"
    font-weight:
        for boldness
        ex. "font-weight: bold"
    font-variant:
        small caps
        ex. "font-variant: small-caps"

Border
    border-width:
        Set border widths
        1 input = all borders
        2 inputs = top-bottom, left-right
        3 inputs = top, left-right, bottom
        4 inputs = top, right, bottom, left
        Think clockwise
    border-color
        set border color
        can specify sides:
            border-top-color, border-bottom-color, etc
        LAST RULE TO APPLY TAKES PRECEDENCE

Padding
    Space between content(text or image) and border

Margin space between object and other object
    margins overlap: largest Margin is full space btwn objects

Classes
    Can be defined on an html object (div, p, etc.)
    All objects of same class receive same css specifications
    in css, start class specifications with ".", eg. ".class{}"

Id's 
    Similar to classes, but supposed to only be used on one object
    specifiacations start with #

Background
    affects background of content space

css selectors
    affect all classes of an element type:
    - p.class
    affect two different elem types:
    - div, P
    affect all of one type of element found inside another type of element:
    div p (All paragraphs inside a div)

    setting rules for when effects take place:
        a: link
            site hasn't been visited recently
        a: visited
            site has been visited recently
        a: hover
            mouse is over the link
        a: active
            link is actively being clicked
        
        as always, ORDER MATTERS
        stuff like hover and active work on objects like paragraphs

    :nth-child(n)
        select all child objects that are child n of parent
        n can be a number, or odd or even
    
    :selection
        changes highlighted objects
        can change background-color and color
