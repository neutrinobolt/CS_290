# Assignment 4: Javascript Basics

Last updated Readme: 3/8/24

## Plan

There are 2 goals for this assignment:

1. Demonstrate and implement Javascript basics in a webpage
2. Find a JS library that could be useful, and attempt to implement it

### Goal 1

For this I will add a comments section to my silly blog's home page.
Typically these would be present on every post, but I want to get it
working on just one page before I try to add it in all over the place.
This will display a text box that will accept up to 50 chars for a comment,
and a submit button. Whenever the submit button is pressed, the text inside
the the text box will be taken in as input and be output wrapped in a paragraph
object.

### Goal 2

After asking for good and simple libraries to add to my blog project, I decided
to go with moment.js to accurately display date and time information for posts
and comments.
