# Assignment 1

## Explanation

My idea for this project is a sort of blog where I can post updates on any
projects I'm working on at a time -- a sort of devlog, or potentially just
a digital journal. It would require a few things to work:

## Needed items

- Home page displaying basic information and latest posts
- Page restricted to only me (password protected?) for creating posts
- Sorted pages displaying only posts of the same genre
