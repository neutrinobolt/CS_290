# Assignment 2: HTML and CSS

## Plan

For this website I'm using the same basic html files that were used for assignment 1, with some additions and changes as needed. To these files I will be making some style changes using CSS.

## Changes to add

- Background and div coloring and style
Backgrounds and borders of divs will receive coloring and style changes to increase aesthetics
and readability of page. This includes changing text size and color for anchors and
timestamps. (CSS)

- Article blurbs on homepage
With an anchor to each connected post will be included a small descriptive blurb detailing
what the article talks about.
