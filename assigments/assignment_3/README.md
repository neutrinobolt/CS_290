# Assignment 3: More Advanced HTML and CSS

- Last Updated 2/26/24

## Plan

Now I will be implementing some more things to my website to make it cleaner and smoother.

## Changes to add

- More small articles and a list of categories

- Add media queries, reformat page according to available screen size

- Improve navbar style (horizontal on bigger screens, stays in place, collapsible vertical
on smaller screens)

- Add breadcrumbs to pages

### Home page

- Format recent posts list so they show up side by side

- Find a way to resize George

### Article pages

- Add links to bottom of each article leading to next one in the category,
next posted and most recently posted

- Add breadcrumbs (Mostly consist of home link, category links) located in sandwich
menu mobile, left side on bigger

### if time

- Consider reformatting so that all articles of one category show up on same page
to decrease number of files required

- If I'm REALLY jonesing for something to do, make Spanish translations of some major pages

## End Results

With some work I was able to get all items in the To Add section added. I added
some basic media queries just to change the text size to be bigger in a PC view,
I updated the navbar to be horizontal and to also contain breadcrumbs that appear when hovered over.
I also updated the category list but didn't take the time to write more entries. Then finally
I updated the home page so that posts apppear next to each other to save space
and look better.
