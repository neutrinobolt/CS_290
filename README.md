5 websites and my thoughts:
###1. Wikipedia https://www.wikipedia.org/
The starting page has very little to it, other than a laguage selection and the search bar. This makes sense given the main purpose of the site.
As for how it organizes the page for articles, I like that it is very straightforward. The introductory information is always front and center, with links to jump lower
on the page for convenience. Good organization.
Improvement would be to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
###2. IMDB https://www.imdb.com/
Right off the bat I got frustrated when as I scrolled down, an ad followed me, obscuring nearly half the screen, but disappeared by itself shortly after.
I understand the necessity for ads, but there must be a less frustrating way to advertize.
Improvement: Shrink down the ad and make it easier to get rid of
###3. Cool Math Games (Yes, this site is still going.)
I like that it shows multiple categories of games at once: New additions alongside the most popular. It allows for more options to be visible.
Improvement: Perhaps make the game lists scroll horizontally, similar to Netflix or Disney Plus.
###4. Spotify https://open.spotify.com/
Perhaps this is because I'm just more familiar with the mobile app layout, but I find the Spotify website a little hard to navigate. Also
I had to scroll way too far to find my playlists.
Improvement: Get rid of unnecessary additions such as audiobook recommendations. I've never listened to an audiobook on spotify,
why are you recommending me these?
###5. Youtube https://www.youtube.com/
Once again with the huge annoying ads! But I've already spoken about that. One feature that I've never seen a use for is the genre filters that are 
generated at the top of the page. They ususally aren't that helpful. If I'm looking for something specific I'll just use the search feature.
Improvement: Ditch the genre filters.
