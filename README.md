5 websites and my thoughts:

### 1. Wikipedia

https://www.wikipedia.org/

The starting page has very little to it, other than a laguage selection and the search bar. This makes sense given the main purpose of the site.
As for how it organizes the page for articles, I like that it is very straightforward. The introductory information is always front and center, with links to jump lower
on the page for convenience. Good organization.
Improvement would be to make it more aesthetically pleasing.

- end of term review:
I still mostly agree with my previous review, however I understand better
why the site is kept so visually minimalistic: Formatting styles can be an
absolute pain. One thing that I think could make it more helpful however
is if the site included some breadcrumb-like system showing the order of the
pages you clicked to get to where you are to allow better navigation

### 2. IMDB

https://www.imdb.com/

Right off the bat I got frustrated when as I scrolled down, an ad followed me, obscuring nearly half the screen, but disappeared by itself shortly after.
I understand the necessity for ads, but there must be a less frustrating way to advertize.
Improvement: Shrink down the ad and make it easier to get rid of.

- End of the term review:
This site is quite well put together. Whatever large ad I was complaining
about before couldn't be found this time, so either it wasn't as big as I
said or they've changed the site. They have quite a few useful features
including a watchlist to keep track of what you want to watch later (though
if I'd named it I'd pobably have named it the "watch later" list, but names
don't really matter much in this context). I did however notice that it
seemed to be recommending similar movies in sections like "Top 10" and
"Fan favorites". These just felt really redundant. Of course if something
is a fan facovite, it's gonna be in the top 10 or adjacent!

### 3. Cool Math Games (Yes, this site is still going.)

https://www.coolmathgames.com

I like that it shows multiple categories of games at once: New additions alongside the most popular. It allows for more options to be visible.
Improvement: Perhaps make the game lists scroll horizontally, similar to Netflix or Disney Plus.

- end of term review:
Still a quite simple site. Though ads are annoyingly inevitable, I appreciate
that they don't stick to the view, and go away when you scroll down. I also
saw that they have a login ability, which I never in my early school life knew
about. I assume that would allow you to keep track of game data between visits,
and that sort of knowledge would have caused my middle school grades to tank
even worse than they already did.

### 4. Spotify

https://open.spotify.com/

Perhaps this is because I'm just more familiar with the mobile app layout, but I find the Spotify website a little hard to navigate. Also
I had to scroll way too far to find my playlists.
Improvement: Get rid of unnecessary additions such as audiobook recommendations. I've never listened to an audiobook on spotify,
why are you recommending me these?

- end of term review:
They've done some serious work to make this site personalized to the user.
It's truly remarkable. Not only are the recommended genres completely based on
your listening history, but they will compile playlists that represent your
listening preferences by day. Whatever AI they have running that thing, it
better get paid very well once it gains sentience.

## 5. Youtube

https://www.youtube.com/

Once again with the huge annoying ads! But I've already spoken about that. One feature that I've never seen a use for is the genre filters that are
generated at the top of the page. They ususally aren't that helpful. If I'm looking for something specific I'll just use the search feature.
Improvement: Ditch the genre filters.

- Honestly, the ads don't bother me too much. They manage to make sure that
the videos are the main focus, so all ads are just mingled into the other
videos. I think I just had some things against advertisement I wanted to
let loose at the start of term. Looking at it now, however, I think that
it would be good if they split the viewing history page from the profile page.

## Self-review

If I were to see the blog I've worked on this term at the beginning of term,
I don't think I would have appreciated it very much. It doesn't look very
nice and doesn't work very well, though it does what it's supposed to. If
I'd given myself more time to make it nice and snazzy, I probably would
have looked into a way to create new articles from a text box, or created a
login system. However having discovered Neocities, I may just try and set up
the blog on there instead.
